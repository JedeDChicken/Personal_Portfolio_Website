# Personal Portfolio Website

*This showcases many of my projects and exercises related to computer engineering, encompassing fields such as Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems, and General Programming and Electronics. It is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, plus additional extensions, deployed using Vercel or Netlify, and features media queries for devices from 350px width. This served as valuable practice and exploration of elementary web development. Dive deeper into the works I have done, learn more about me, and feel free to get in touch.
